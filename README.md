### Sample Data:
- **Solar Production**: Peak production during daylight hours (6 AM - 6 PM) with realistic sun cycle patterns
- **Weather Conditions**: Simulated cloud cover, temperature variations, and seasonal effects
- **Panel Performance**: Efficiency variations based on temperature and irradiance levels
- **System Health**: Active panel counts and system capacity monitoring
- **Environmental Factors**: Ambient temperature, panel temperature, and solar irradiance data

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualizations**: Plotly
- **Backend**: Python 3.8+
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, Railway

## üìã Requirements

```
streamlit==1.28.1
pandas==2.1.1
numpy==1.24.3
plotly==5.17.0
python-dateutil==2.8.2
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- No environment variables required for basic operation
- All data is generated using realistic simulation algorithms

### Customization
- Modify `data_generator.py` to connect to real energy monitoring APIs
- Adjust time ranges and refresh intervals in `app.py`
- Customize themes in `.streamlit/config.toml`

## üìà Data Sources

Currently uses simulated data that mimics real solar energy patterns:
- **Solar Production**: Follows realistic sun cycle with seasonal variations
- **Weather Data**: Simulated irradiance, cloud cover, and temperature effects
- **Panel Performance**: Efficiency variations based on temperature and environmental conditions
- **System Status**: Panel health monitoring and capacity tracking

### Connecting Real Data
To connect real solar data sources, modify the `SolarEnergyDataGenerator` class:
```python
# Replace simulation with real solar API calls
def get_real_solar_data():
    # Connect to solar inverter APIs or weather services
    # Examples: SolarEdge API, Enphase API, OpenWeatherMap
    pass
```

## üåç Environmental Impact Calculations

- **CO‚ÇÇ Avoided**: Based on 0.5 kg CO‚ÇÇ per kWh from fossil fuels
- **Homes Powered**: Average home consumption of 30 kWh per day
- **Tree Equivalent**: 22 kg CO‚ÇÇ absorption per tree per year
